### Hi! I'm Alan.

* Passionate software engineer. (I ♥️ Ruby!)
* Empathetic leader @meraki.
* Fallible human.
* Environmentalist. Feminist. Ally.
* Artist. Musician.
* Goofball.

My favorite repos are pinned below. Here's why they are my favorites:

* **manufacturable**: A tool for industrial strength self-registration. One of the finest pieces of code @Fito and I have ever written.
* **liberty**: An experimental web framework based on self-registration and the Single Responsibility Principle.
* **coffee**: The code to support the talk @Fito and I gave at RubyConf Mini 2022 and RailsConf 2023.
* **manager-README**: A place where candidates and new hires can get to know me.

My @aridlehoover account is actually not that interesting. If you want to see my best work, check out @first-try-software. That's where @Fito and I hang out together and dream of better ways to write software on the first try.
