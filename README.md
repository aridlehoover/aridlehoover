## Hi! I'm Alan.

### Here's a little bit about me:

* I am a passionate software engineer. I love Ruby. And, I'm particularly interested in helping others learn to write structurally simple code that feels nimble and maleable. 

* I am an empathetic leader at Cisco Meraki where I support a team of 36 platform engineers and managers working to enable other engeineers across the organization do their best work for our customers.

* I am a fallible human being. We all are. But, I like to remind myself.

* I am an environmentalist, a feminist, and an ally because I have children and I want their world to be healthy, more fair, and more just than mine.

* I am an artist, a musician, and a goofball because that's how I express myself.

### My favorite repos are pinned below. Here's why they are my favorites:

* **manufacturable**: A tool for industrial strength self-registration. One of the finest pieces of code [@Fito](https://github.com/Fito) and I have ever written.
* **liberty**: An experimental web framework based on self-registration and the Single Responsibility Principle.
* **coffee**: The code to support the talk [@Fito](https://github.com/Fito) and I gave at RubyConf Mini 2022 and RailsConf 2023.
* **manager-README**: A place where candidates and new hires can get to know me.

My personal account is actually not that interesting. If you want to see my best publicly available work, check out [@first-try-software](https://github.com/first-try-software). That's where @Fito and I hang out together and dream of better ways to write software on the first try.
